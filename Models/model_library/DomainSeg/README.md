## DomainSeg
Roadwork scenes and construction objects present a challenging edge-case scenario for self-driving cars. Roadwork objects can be placed dynamically and their position can be changed at a moments notice by construction workers. On many occassions, roadwork objects can be used to artifically narrow the driving corridor and guide vehicles to merge lanes. These scenarios are very demanding for self-driving cars, creating a need for a robust and reliable roadwork scene segmentation technology. DomainSeg addresses this key technology gap, delivering robust safety perception across urban driving scenarios, highways and even unstrcutured roads. It is able to adapt to challenging weather conditions such as snow and low-light, and is robust to edge cases such as detection of traffic cones that have been knocked over by other cars. DomainSeg is part of the [AutoSeg Foundation Model](../AutoSeg/README.md) which forms the core of the vision-pipeline of the [Autoware Privately Owned Vehicle Autonomous Highway Pilot System](..).

During training, DomainSeg estimates a binary segmentation mask with a probability of each pixel belonging to a single 'super-class' of **roadwork objects**
