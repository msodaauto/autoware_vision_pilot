## Open-source highway autonomy system
This codebase contains **productionizable and safety certifiable code for an open-source ADAS and Full Self Driving** system that can power safe autonomous driving around the world. It is designed to be integrated with automotive OEMs and Tier-1 suppliers in series production passenger cars. We offer the complete codebase as free and fully open-source, including the release of all of our model architectures, data parsing scripts, training pipelines and model weights to help democratize access to this vital technology. All of our technology is available under the persmissive Apache 2.0 licence and can freely be used for both commercial and research purposes.

To learn more about how to participate in this project, please read the [onboarding guide](/ONBOARDING.md)

## End-to-End AI Architecture
We utilize an **End-to-End AI Architecture** in which each component technology of the Vision Pilot system is powered through neural-networks. Over the evolution of the project, we are introducing component-based/modular End-to-End AI, full monolithic End-to-End AI, as well as a new Hybrid End-to-End AI framework for optimal system explainability, introspection, verification and safety validation.

## No Reliance on High Definition Maps
**We do not require 3D high definition  maps**. Our stack can operate in a 'mapless' mode or use existing 2D navigational (sat-nav style) maps, also called ADAS maps. Human beings can drive without prior knowledge of the detailed 3D geometry of roadways by relying on real-time scene perception, and our system mimics this process.

## Technology Roadmap
Rather than going for a single moonshot, we are sequentially building the core software stack of the Vision Pilot system in a modular manner, and releasing versions of the Vision Pilot system that serve a core customer need, where each new release expands upon the operational-design-domain, technology prowess and safety envelope of the prior release.

As part of our technology roadmap, we will sequentially develop three versions of the Autoware Autonomous Highway Pilot System, called:
- ***[Vision Pilot - Level 2+ highway autopilot through component-based End-to-End AI](/VisionPilot/)***
- ***Vision Pilot PRO - Level 2+ highway and urban autopilot through monolithic End-to-End AI***
- ***Vision Drive - Level 4+ all road autonomy using hybrid End-to-End AI***
